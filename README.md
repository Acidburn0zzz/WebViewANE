### Update 26/10/2019

The compiled binary (the .ane file) is no longer provided free of charge.    
It is now provided inside a ***password protected*** zip file in [releases](https://github.com/tuarua/WebViewANE/releases).

##### How do I get the password?

You can make a one-off payment via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=YZ3M5H58GDSLQ).   
You will be emailed the password to allow you to unzip the file and access the .ane file(s).    
This password will work for the ***current*** and any ***future*** versions.

##### Wait... is the project still open source?

The project remains open source.  
Open source is often wrongly confused as synonymous with 'free' i.e. free binaries / email support / updates / bug fixes / tutorials / consultation.   
Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and compile.  

##### I have previously donated to the project, can I get the password?
Those who have kindly previously already can send an email to [info@tuarua.co.uk](mailto:info@tuarua.co.uk) to enquire about this.

##### I don't want to pay for the compiled ane. What can I do?

You can build the ane from the source code in this repo.
